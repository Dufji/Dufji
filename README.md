### ðŸ¤” Who am I?

I am currently 19 years old, currently attending a community college and planning to transfer to a high level university. I want to do freelance programming and want to be a bigger YouTuber in the future. I have been fascinated with technology for as long as I can remember. Hope you will like some of my public projects on my GitHub page! I don't have EVERYTHING public for personal reasons. Some will be though!

## What am I familiar with? :Thonk:

I currently know C++ (5 Months of Experience!) and Python (9 Months of Experience).

I want to learn Java and Kotlin in the future. I plan to study those during the summer break!
